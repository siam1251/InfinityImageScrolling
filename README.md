## Mobile Engineering Challenge

### Overview

The purpose of this test is to evaluate technical skills, experience and creativity. The problem is open-ended to give you a chance to highlight your skills so that your application stands out.

- iOS applicants should use Objective-C or Swift; Android applicants should use Java or Kotlin.
- Please consider a testing strategy for your solution.
- You may use third party libraries in your project.
- We expect this problem to require about 4 hours of effort.

### Submission

Please pay attention to these instructions:
- Fork the repository https://github.com/figure1engineering/mobile-challenge/
- When ready open a pull request against YOUR forked repository. Do NOT open a pull request against the parent repository (we want to keep submissions private).
- Send us an email when your PR is ready for review. Most of the time we will merge your PR and review the solution internally. If we have questions we will ask those in the open pull request before merging.

### Problem

Display a feed of images with captions using the Imgur API (https://apidocs.imgur.com/). Use the client ID `e0d9382b96f900b` for accessing the API. The feed should support infinite scrolling and implement a detail view for each image. You are welcome to add other features, documentation or refine the solution in any way that you see fit.

Good luck!
