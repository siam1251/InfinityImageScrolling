### Problem

Display a feed of images with captions using the Imgur API (https://apidocs.imgur.com/). Use the client ID `e0d9382b96f900b` for accessing the API. The feed should support infinite scrolling and implement a detail view for each image. You are welcome to add other features, documentation or refine the solution in any way that you see fit.

Good luck!
